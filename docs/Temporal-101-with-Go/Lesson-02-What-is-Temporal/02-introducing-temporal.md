`Temporal`
#

> - A platform that guarantees the durable execution of your application code.
> - It allows you to develop as if failures don't even exist.
> - Your application will run reliably even if it encounters problems, such as network outages or server crashes, which would be catastrosphic for a typical application.
> - The Temporal platform handles these types of problems, allowing you to focus on the business logic, instead of writing application code to detect and recover from failures.

# Workflows

`Workflows`
#

> - The abstraction where Temporal applications are built.
> - Workflows are develop by writing code in a general-purpose programming language such as Go.
> - The code you write is the same code that will be executed at runtime, so you can use your favorite tools and libraries to develop Temporal Workflows.
> - Temporal workflows are resilient.
> - They can run - and keeping running - for years, even if the underlying infrastructure fails.
> - If the application itself crashes, Temporal will automatically recreate its pre-failure state so it can continue right where it left off.
